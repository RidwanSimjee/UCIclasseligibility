# UCIclasseligibility
At UCI, computer science majors have free reign to take whatever computer science classes they like to complete a computer science degree. As a result, whenever choosing classes, the issue becomes, having to routinely check the long list of courses and assess
which classes a student is eligible to take (based on its given prerequisites). This application simplifies that tedious process, asking the user for relevant course work and offering classes the student would be eligibile to take.

All retrieval of up to date course information is made possible by the open source project, Peter Portal public API.
